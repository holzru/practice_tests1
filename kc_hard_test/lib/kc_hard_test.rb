# Back in the good old days, you used to be able to write a darn near
# uncrackable code by simply taking each letter of a message and incrementing it
# by a fixed number, so "abc" by 2 would look like "cde", wrapping around back
# to "a" when you pass "z".  Write a function, `caesar_cipher(str, shift)` which
# will take a message and an increment amount and outputs the encoded message.
# Assume lowercase and no punctuation. Preserve spaces.
#
# To get an array of letters "a" to "z", you may use `("a".."z").to_a`. To find
# the position of a letter in the array, you may use `Array#find_index`.

# Write a method, `digital_root(num)`. It should Sum the digits of a positive
# integer. If it is greater than 10, sum the digits of the resulting number.
# Keep repeating until there is only one digit in the result, called the
# "digital root". **Do not use string conversion within your method.**
#
# You may wish to use a helper function, `digital_root_step(num)` which performs
# one step of the process.

# Jumble sort takes a string and an alphabet. It returns a copy of the string
# with the letters re-ordered according to their positions in the alphabet. If
# no alphabet is passed in, it defaults to normal alphabetical order (a-z).

# jumble_sort("hello") => "ehllo"
# jumble_sort("hello", ['o', 'l', 'h', 'e']) => 'ollhe'
